<h2>Run frontend locally:</h2>
<p>in the terminal go to frontend folder:</p>
<p>type "npm install" to install npm modules</p>
<p>type "npm run dev" to start the frontend locally</p>
<p>in browser go to: http://localhost:8080</p>
<p>If you want to use the local backend with this frontend you have to make an .env file in the frontend directory:</p>
<p>the next public api url should contain: http://localhost:7071</p>

<p>if there is no .env file in the frontend, the services in the frontend will use the azure functions backend by default.</p>
